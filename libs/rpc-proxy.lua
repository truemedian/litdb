--[[
 - Agents have a name/uuid that allows client to request them.  This works
   similar to the DNS system used to resolve domain names to IP addresses.
 - When an agent connects to a proxy, it declared it's name and is assigned an
   address on the local network. (star topology with proxy server in center)
 - When a client connects to a proxy, it requests an agent by name/uuid.  The
   proxy then assigns a local address to the client and tells it the address of
   the requested agent.
 - Every message in the system is prefixed with dest/source so that the proxy
   knows where to route messages.
 - An empty message is sent or synthesized when a connection is broken.  So if
   an agent dies or looses it's connection with the proxy, the proxy will send
   empty messages to all clients who were interested in that agent as if they
   came from the agent.

This means we need the following mappings in a proxy:
